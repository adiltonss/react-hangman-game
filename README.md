#A hangman game built with reactjs

The is a simple hangman game, since I"m learning about reactjs I've decided to test everything I've seen until now with this project.

Now about the game, every word comes from a fecth to the dicionario-aberto.net api, the word comes from an online brazilian portuguese dictionary.

If you miss 4 times, in 5th the game gives you a tip which is the meaning of the word.

Here's the link to the project: https://react-hangman-game-eth712yjv-adiltonss.vercel.app/
